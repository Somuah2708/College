# Instagram-Style Video Implementation Summary

## What We Built

Your Home screen now has **Instagram-style auto-playing videos** that work exactly like Instagram Stories and Reels! Here's what we implemented:

### ðŸŽ¥ Video Features Implemented

#### 1. **Auto-Play When Scrolling**
- Videos automatically start playing when they come into the center of your screen
- Only one video plays at a time (Instagram behavior)
- Videos pause when you scroll away from them

#### 2. **Instagram-Style Controls**
- **Tap to Play/Pause**: Tap anywhere on the video to play or pause
- **Mute/Unmute Button**: Bottom-right corner speaker icon to toggle sound
- Videos start **muted by default** (Instagram style)
- **Duration Badge**: Shows video length with clock icon
- **Views Counter**: Shows "1.2K views" style counter

#### 3. **Visual Design**
- Videos fill the full width with proper aspect ratio
- Play button overlay when video is paused
- Gradient overlay for better text readability
- Smooth animations and transitions

### ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

#### Backend Integration
- **Posts Table**: Your existing table with `video_url` column
- **Post Media Table**: New table for multiple media per post
- **Supports Both**: Legacy `video_url` and new `post_media` table

#### Video Component
```typescript
// Uses expo-av Video component for native playback
import { Video, ResizeMode } from 'expo-av';

// Instagram-style configuration
<Video
  source={{ uri: post.media_url }}
  resizeMode={ResizeMode.COVER}
  shouldPlay={isVisible}
  isLooping
  isMuted={true} // Start muted like Instagram
  useNativeControls={false} // Custom controls
/>
```

#### Auto-Play Logic
- **Scroll Detection**: Tracks scroll position in real-time
- **Viewport Center**: Plays video when it's in the center of screen
- **Performance Throttled**: Updates every 150ms for smooth performance
- **Memory Efficient**: Only keeps track of visible videos

### ðŸ“± User Experience

#### What Users See:
1. **Scrolling Feed**: Normal posts with images and videos mixed
2. **Video Auto-Play**: Videos start playing automatically when centered
3. **Instagram Controls**: Familiar tap-to-pause, mute button interactions
4. **Visual Feedback**: Play button overlay, duration, view counts
5. **Smooth Performance**: No lag or stuttering during scroll

#### Instagram-Style Behaviors:
- âœ… Auto-play when video enters viewport center

- âœ… Tap video to play/pause
- âœ… Loop videos continuously

### ðŸŽ¯ Test URLs Added

We created test data with working video URLs:
```sql
-- Sample videos that work for testing
'https://sample-videos.com/zip/10/mp4/SampleVideo_1280x720_1mb.mp4'
'https://sample-videos.com/zip/10/mp4/SampleVideo_1280x720_2mb.mp4'
```
